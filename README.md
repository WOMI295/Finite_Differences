# Finite_Differences
This is a short script in excel that can be used to create a finite differences table and use it to calculate the degree and 
the leading coefficient of a polynomial. It should be noted that while those two values are inputs it does not call them in 
in order to find the values it populates to the sheet.

It should also be noted that the code calls for an ActiveX button called 'StartTestButton', and so if this cannot or will not
be used in the program, references to it should be commented out or removed before trying to run the script otherwise it will
cause an error.
